All distance and triangle related problems are based on the formulas.

eg. Distance between 2 points
Input : x1, y1 = (3, 4)
           x2, y2 = (7, 7)
Output : 5
Pythogoras formula , Distance = âˆš((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)
math.sqrt(math.pow(x2-x1,2)+math.pow(y2-y1,2))

Triangle is valid:
A triangle is valid if sum of its 2 sides are greater than third.
i.e. a+b > c; a+c > b; b+c > a
if (a+b <=c) or (a+c <= b) or (b+c <=a) then false
